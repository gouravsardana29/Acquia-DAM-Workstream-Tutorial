# Part 7: Asset Proofing

### 35. Proofing

Proofing means marking up and annotating a creative file. Acquia DAM provides a powerful proofing tool that can be used to proof image, video, and other files.

Whether or not you are DAM user, you may be asked to proof an asset in the DAM. You can respond to these requests by clicking on the link in the email notification requesting your approval, or the link in the in-app notification that appears in the DAM when you log in.

* See “Approval Pending” in Asset Details on right.
* Click “View Request” and then “View proof” at the top right to add your comments, and approve the asset.
* You can also view an asset’s proof directly from an asset that’s not in the approval process.

To proof an asset:

* Click View Proof from the approval request on the right side of Asset details
* Click the +, which is to add Feedback.
* Several tools will appear that you can use to add feedback. These will differ based on the type of document being proofed. For image files:
  * There is a **Pencil** to circle and then add comment. The pencil tool allows you to choose the thickness, color and opacity of the lines you draw on an asset. Click Publish to save the comment and the pencil line.
  * There is a **Region** tool to indicate a rectangular area, about which you can add a comment. Click Publish to save the region and the comment.
  * A **Callout** tool allows you to point an arrow to a specific area of the image and make a comment. Click publish to save the callout and the comment.
  * Selecting a line or shape, region, or callout on the image will give you the option to delete it with the trash can icon.
* Other tools on the proofing screen are located under the asset:
  * This small folder is the Asset explorer. Click it and browse other assets that have been related to this asset in the DAM.
  * Compare assets by clicking this icon. The screen will split and allow you to make a side-by-side comparison of two assets \(a previous version and the current version, for example\).
  * Use the slider to zoom in and out of an asset.
  * Or use the caret to select from actual size, fit to width, or fit to screen.
  * Use the rotate arrow to rotate an image. It will rotate 90 degrees at a time.
  * Use the marker icon to show all the markers related to the feedback on this asset. The marker will indicate the comment number, and the location on the image related to the comment. If there is one area of an asset with lots of comments, it may be a good place to put your attention.
  * Use this icon to collapse the side panel and give yourself more space to proof the asset.
* Once feedback has been added, you can sort and filter the feedback using the filter menu here.
* Using this hamburger menu, you can mark the feedback as "read" or you can create a feedback summary, to be sent to the asset owner when feedback is complete.

To proof a video file:

* When proofing a video file, you will see most of the same controls as for image files. However, since it is video, you will have a few extras, including:
  * **Span frames**, which when checked allows you to indicate the entire duration of the video to which the feedback applies. Click the checkbox for span frame, and a brown highlight will appear over the video timeline. Drag the ends of the brown section to the range where your feedback applies using the carets. Then, add your feedback.
  * **Playback rate**, which allows you to select from a dropdown of faster or slower playback speeds.
  * **Player controls**, which allow you to play, rewind, or fast-forward the video,
  * **Video thumbnails** allow you to jump through the video content when editing.
  * The gear icon allows you to loop the video, show as full screen, or show safe areas in the video frame. Safe areas are designated areas in a video in which it is safe to put titles or important action. These safe areas can also help your video file look more balanced, by not placing content up against the edge of videos.

### 36. Generating a Feedback Summary

Using the proofing tool, you can generate a Feedback Summary, to share with editors, graphic designers, or other interested parties. To do this:

* Click on the hamburger menu and choose Feedback Summary.
* This dialog box window will present many options related to the Feedback Summary, including:
  * The format of the summary, and whether you want to include a cover page, omit assets with no feedback, or include page breaks.
  * The assets in the summary, and what details are included or excluded.
  * The feedback itself, and what details are included and excluded.
  * And delivery of the summary, including how it is delivered, its format, and recipients.
* Once you submit a feedback summary, a dialog box appears letting you know that this is being processed and will be sent when complete.
* When complete, recipients will receive an email with a link to download the Feedback Summary.
