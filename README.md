# Acquia DAM Workstream Tutorial

Welcome to the tutorial for the Workstream Add-on for Acquia DAM!

Workstream is a creative project management and workflow module for Acquia DAM. It is used at the beginning of the asset management lifecycle where the following activities occur:

* Submitting requests for new or revised asset\(s\)
* Prioritizing and assigning these requests
* Submitting new assets for approval
* Viewing, commenting, editing, or proofing newly created or revised assets, and
* Publishing approved assets to the requestor \(or more broadly, if you prefer\)

This Acquia DAM Workstream Tutorial has the following learning objectives:

* Successfully gain access to Workstream
* Understand the main navigation and learn your way around
* Gain a basic understanding of the Workstream user interface
* Manage your preferences and settings in Workstream
* Add and manage users in Workstream
* Add and manage Request Forms in Workstream
* Add and manage tasks and projects in Workstream
* Add and manage simple approvals and approval paths in Workstream
* Use Workstream Proofing tools

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have completed Introduction to Acquia DAM Administration training, and are a system administrator of Acquia DAM with the Workstream add-on.

### How is Workstream used?

Using Workstream, you will be able to receive requests, and from those requests, create tasks that you can assign to team members, and create projects to which you can assign these tasks. Here is an example of a project in Workstream:

* A team member is going to a conference and the old presentation templates will just not work for it.
* The team member submits a request for a new asset through Workstream
* The request is processed and assigned to a team member
* The team member completes the asset, and uploads it for proofing and approval
* The asset editor or manager proofs and comments on the asset
* The asset creator edits or adjusts the asset as needed
* The asset editor approves the final asset, making it available to the original requestor. If desired, they can make it available to the rest of the organization as well.

**Here are some common requests that can be managed using Workstream:**

* A new or existing employee needs new business cards
* A colleague needs an updated graphic for a presentation
* The website manager needs a new banner image for a website
* The marketing team needs a full set of assets for a new ad campaign

Unique workflows called "approval paths" can be configured for many different types of requests. Here are some examples of process rules that may be best managed using an approval path:

* A piece of original collateral is designed by an art department team member and requires several approvals before it can be used in public materials.
* Approval by the marketing team is required for an asset to be used for sales.
* Approval by an external client is required for an asset to be used by a vendor, or
* Approval by a print editor and legal are required for this asset to be used in print materials.

**Here are some common work rules that can be managed using approval paths:**

* Upload only approved images to create new assets
* Approve new asset for use in campaign
* Gain legal approval for asset use
* Gain publisher approval for approved asset publication to public

To get the most from Acquia DAM Workstream, consider common requests for creative assets and collateral in your organization that are handled by email, in meetings, casual conversation, or other means. Then, think of the workflows required and the people involved to complete these requests, including approvals. You will want to document these workflows so you can configure them in Acquia DAM.

### Ideal Use-Cases

Acquia DAMâ€™s Workstream is ideal if:

* You have a smaller Creative team with fewer than 20 members
* You initiate 20-30 projects per month within your creative team
* You want to support your distributed creative teams by providing them one place to keep communication on the status of assets in creation
* Your team members need a tool for markups, approvals, and tracking of assets in progress

Please NOTE: Workstream is NOT designed to replace a project management solution. Workstream is specifically designed to support the creative asset creation and management process \(not entire projects\). Workstream does not accommodate resource tracking and allocation such as Gantt charting or scheduling.
