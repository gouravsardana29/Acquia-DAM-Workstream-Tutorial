### 25. Creating a New Project

**Note**: Only administrators can create new projects. When a new project is created, it is initially hidden from all non-Administrative users. Once users are added, or assigned tasks, they can see the project.

To create a new project:

* Click on the **“+ New Project”** button at the top of the page.
* In the resulting dialog box, assign the groups to whom this project will be visible
* Fill out the project name, project sponsor \(this is required, and must be someone within the company that has a Workstream license\), launch date for the project, and a project description.
* Click on the **Create** button to create the project.
* This project will now show up on the project tab in list view, and to those assigned to it.

### 36. Editing your Project or Task List View

You can edit the visible columns in your Project list view and your task list view.

* Click on the "more options" menu in the upper right corner of the page.
* A Project or Task columns dialog box will appear that contains a listing of all possible column options.
* Select the columns you wish to appear.
* Click Save to save the configuration.
* You will note that you need to scroll left and right to see all columns when many are enabled.
* Going back to the "more options" menu and clicking Edit Columns, you have the option of resetting the columns to the default.

### 27. Exporting Data from the Project List View

You can export date from your project list view or task list view.

* Click on the "more options" menu in the upper right corner of the view.
* Click Export data.
* A progress message will appear, noting that you will receive a notification and email when this is complete.
* A link to download the exported data is sent to your account email address. If you follow the link, you can download the exported data in .CSV format.

### 28. Viewing a project’s dashboard

From the Workstream landing page, click on the Projects tab. You will see that this list view shows you all the active projects, their due dates, \# of related assets, % completion, and the projects' watchers.

* Click on the desired project from the list view
* This will bring you to the project dashboard, providing you with a high-level view of what is going on with a specific project.
* From here you can see any details related to a project. You can add and assign tasks, add and assign assets, and see the progress of the project.
* This view will show all assets related to a project, whether they are at the project level or the task level. Assets are labeled with the task name or the project, to indicate whether they are project or task assets.
* Click on any of the asset files to get a larger view of the asset and any information related to it. You can also see a larger view, and proof the asset.
  * If you click on an asset, or
  * If new versions of images have been uploaded, you can compare two images.

### 29. Assigning Tasks to a Project

To assign a task to a project:

* Click on **Tasks** to go to the Task table view.
* On the right hand side of the task or tasks you wish to assign to a project, click on the the "more options" menu \(you must hover over the right side to see the menu\)
* Select **Move to Project**.
* Using the dropdown, select the project and then click **Save** to save the configuration.

  
To add tasks to a project from the project dashboard view.

* In the remaining tasks block, click the plus icon to add tasks
* Select the correct Request Form from the resulting dialog box.
* Complete the desired Request Form.
* When saved, this will add your task to the project.

### 30. Using Projects as Templates for other Projects

It can take a lot of work to develop a project and all of its associated tasks, checklists, and details. You may want to use a fully developed project as a template for a new project, to save yourself time. To do this:

* Go to the project’s dashboard view
* Click the "more options" menu next to the project title.
* From this menu, select Duplicate Project.
* A new project will be created as a copy of the original project, which you can edit as new.
