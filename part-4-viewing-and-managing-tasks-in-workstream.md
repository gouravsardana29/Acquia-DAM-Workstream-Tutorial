# Part 4: Viewing and Managing Tasks in Workstream

In these lessons, you will learn:

* How to view tasks assigned to you
* About task management options
* About filtering tasks
* Changing your view of tasks
* Editing, commenting, and working on tasks

### 20. Viewing Tasks

The task tab will show tasks that have been created within a project, as well as tasks that have been submitted via a Request Form.

The Tasks tab in Workstream allows a Workstream user to see all requests and tasks that have been assigned to them and what their status is.

To view the task main screen:

* Click on the **Tasks** Tab from the main Workstream page.
* Here you will see a list of tasks with their status, ID, Title, Due Date, Assignee, and Watchers
* The table of tasks can be filtered by clicking on the carat next to **All Tasks** in the upper right corner.
* Your view of the tasks can be changed by clicking on the carat next to the List view icon on the task tab.

### 21. Task Management Options

From the Task list view, you can manage tasks in various ways:

* Change the assignee of a task \(this will give you the option of sending a notification to the assignee, letting them know the task was assigned\)
* Move the task to a project
* Change the task’s status
* Duplicate the task if you want to create a new task with similar details
* Delete the task if it is outdated or unwanted for another reason

### 22. Filtering Tasks

Filtering offers many options to make it easier to manage your tasks.

* Click on the filter dropdown from the Task view, which defaults to All Tasks
* You can filter your view by selecting one of the options here
* Options include
  * All tasks
  * Your watched tasks
  * Recently viewed tasks
  * Tasks due soon, and
  * Orphan Tasks, or those not associated with a Project.

You can further filter this view by toggling any of the filter options in the dropdown to the right, and entering details in the field that appears:

* Options include:
  * Keywords in the task’s title
  * Task creator
  * Task assignee, and
  * Task status
  * You can also hide completed tasks using the On/Off toggle here

### 23. Changing Your View of Tasks

You can adjust your personal view of tasks using the "view select" dropdown.

* Select "Calendar view" to show tasks listed on a calendar on their scheduled due date
  * On the Calendar view, you can jump to today’s date, toggle between months, and change your view to a month, a week, or a 5-day view.
  * Change the month or week view to a 5-day view by moving the toggle for Hide weekends.
* Select "List view" to show tasks listed in table form with sortable columns.
  * You can sort these columns by clicking on the column header.
  * Clicking again will change the order to the reverse \(to reverse alphabetical order, or oldest items first\).

### 24. Editing, Commenting, and Working on Tasks

To work on a specific task:

* Click on the desired task in the Task table.
* This will take you to the task view.
* On the task view screen, you can:
  * Assign tasks
  * Assign or adjust due dates
  * Attach assets either from Acquia DAM or from a computer, or
  * Add comments
  * A checklist of specific sub-tasks can be created for this task by either administrators or the assignee of the task.
  * If you want to, you can add keywords that will be added to any asset uploaded as part of a task. So, if at some point you wanted to search for all assets that had to do with a certain event, you could do that.
* Notify the watchers of a task by clicking on Watchers, and adding a message you want to send to them.
